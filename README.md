## 🏆 Hackathon Journey

Synapse was built as part of the **#TechTrix Software Development @ RCCIIT, Kolkata 2025** hackathon. Our dedicated team—**Pritam Das, Suparno Saha, and Mohikshit Ghorai**—worked tirelessly during an online building period of **36 hours**, followed by a **5-hour offline session** where we pitched our app. The judges provided invaluable feedback, which we quickly incorporated into the project. Our efforts culminated in securing **🏆 1st position** in the hackathon—a milestone that marked our very first hackathon win.

## 🔄 Project Status

This version of Synapse was created as a standalone, polished hackathon entry. It showcases the current functionalities available in our experimental phase. **Note:** Synapse will not be maintained or updated further, serving as a milestone project celebrating our hackathon success.
